## Adaboost
Adaboost is an boosting ensemble learning method
which combines weak classifiers into one strong classifier.
It does so by training the weak classifiers on the missclassified 
from the previous classifier, thus learning the missclassified
If enough weak classifier present, we can divide the hyperspace into
multiple segments, because the weak classifiers learn to classify segments
thus when combining the classifier and their learned segments
we can strongly classify other examples.
